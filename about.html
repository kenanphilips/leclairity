      <div class="about-bio">
        <p>I received my Bachelors of Arts degree in Psychology at the University of Victoria and my Masters of Counselling Degree from City University of Seattle. During my Masters Program, I was an Intern at Citizens’ Counselling Center under the supervision of registered clinical counsellor, Marilyn Murdock. While working at Citizens’ and other organizations, such as Vancouver Island Health Authority, Salvation Army, and Aids Vancouver Island, I supported clients with various difficulties ranging from grief and loss, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, relationship difficulties, and different forms of trauma. Supporting clients who had experienced trauma, such as sexualized violence, inspired me to focus my thesis project on social responses towards sexualized violence. Throughout my research I learned the value of Response-Based Therapy, which I often implement when supporting clients who have experienced trauma.</p>

        <p>In addition to supporting adults with mental-health challenges, I have extensive experience working with children and youth with a range of developmental abilities. I have supported children and youth who have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as those who struggle with Depression, Anxiety, Substance abuse, Eating disorders, self-harm, and their sexual-identity. My ability to connect with children and youth has given me the privilege of seeing these young people develop and improve on their therapeutic goals.</p>

        <div class="about-img karlie2"></div>

        <p>Most recently, I have began my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology, and intend to focus my dissertation on responses towards trauma and sexualized violence. My hope is to expand on the research of my Master’s thesis to learn how we as a community can support individuals who have experienced trauma. After many years of valuable academic and professional experience, I am confident in my abilities as your counsellor to help you in achieving your therapeutic goals. I am confident that with my experience, passion to help others, and all the pre-existing skills that you as a client will bring into counselling, we can work towards the therapeutic goals that you have set out for yourself.</p>
