        <p>Mental-health is something that effects each and every one of us at one time or another. All of us have experienced emotions on some level, but sometimes these feelings can intensify making them difficult to cope with on our own. What often makes it difficult for us to reach out for help is the fear of being stigmatized or judged for the difficulties we are having. We as humans cope in a variety of different ways that may not always ‘make sense’ from the outsider’s perspective. We are often quick to judge ourselves or others for behaving or feeling a certain way. This judgement and this fear is what keeps us stuck where we are. So how do we become unstuck?</p>

      <div class="center">
        <p>My personal philosophy is that every single feeling, thought, and behaviour makes sense within the context that it is in. My belief is that if you look at what is happening in our environment, it becomes clear that we are as humans are just responding in the best way we know how. Whether it be addiction, anger, sadness, or fear, our feelings and behaviours are all just responses to the environment that we are in. I believe that if we can look at mental-health from this perspective, we will be much more likely to understand and accept why we feel and behave in the way we do. This perspective is the missing puzzle piece that can help us work towards a healthier psychological state. We can then become unstuck.</p>

      <div class="center">
        <p>As your counsellor, I can promise to provide you with an environment free of judgement regardless of the reasons you are seeking counselling. I promise to tailor my therapeutic approach to your individual needs and not expect you to tailor yourself to my approach. Lastly, I promise you that taking a risk and asking for help can be a life-changing decision that can open up a whole new realm of possibilities for you and the life you want to live.</p>
