          <h2>Welcome to LeClair’ity Counselling!</h2>
          <p>Mental-health is something that effects each and every one of us at one time or another. All of us have experienced emotions on some level, but sometimes these feelings can intensify making them difficult to cope with on our own. What often makes it difficult for us to reach out for help is the fear of being stigmatized or judged for the difficulties we are having. We as humans cope in a variety of different ways that may not always ‘make sense’ from the outsider’s perspective. We are often quick to judge ourselves or others for behaving or feeling a certain way. This judgement and this fear is what keeps us stuck where we are. So how do we become unstuck?</p>
